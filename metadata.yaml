description: And maybe I ain't. Sinclair brushed the entire argument away into a thin
  mist of smoke. ""Now, look here, Cold Feet, I'm about to go to sleep, and when I
  sleep, I sure sleep sound, taking it by and large. They's times when I don't more'n
  close one eye all night, and they's times when you'd have to pull my eyes open,
  one by one, to wake me up. Understand? I'm going to sleep the second way tonight.
  About eight hours of the soundest sleep you ever heard tell of.""
